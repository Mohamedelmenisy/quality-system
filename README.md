1.  **Backend Choice**: The system is designed to be compatible with **Supabase** or **Firebase** for easy setup of database and authentication.
2.  **API Connection**: Each page will fetch and post data via a REST API.
3.  **Data Source**: Data can be pulled from Google Sheets, Metabase, or any other database through the backend.
4.  **Authentication**: The login and signup pages will be connected to the chosen authentication service.
